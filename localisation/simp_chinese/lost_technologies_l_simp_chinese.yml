 advanced_automated_industries_DESC:0  "For millennia, the Fallen Empires have relied upon their automated industries to fuel their economy and satisfy demands of their population. However, our archaeological teams have now found evidence that suggest even more powerful versions of their surviving buildings had existed in the past, with the technology to build them since lost to the ages.\n\nPiecing together clues from ancient artifacts and combining our current knowledge of automated buildings, our scientists believe we may yet have a shot at recovering the lost technologies of these powerful constructs."

 lost_technologies.1.desc:0  "Time has not been kind to the Fallen Empires. Once mighty civilizations that wielded tremendous power, able to bend the galaxy to their will. For centuries, their civilizations shined like beacons in the dark, and they were the envy of primitives and savages. In the end, not even their greatest advances and innovations survived the passing of time. Time is the ultimate judge of civilizations.\n\nBut what if there is a way to undo the damage time has caused? What if we can piece together what little information that remained, so the greatest inventions of the past can come to life once more? Many secrets lay buried within the artifacts we gathered, often referring to technologies which have since been lost. The legends of these lost technologies and their feats however, remain a popular discussion for the §H[Root.GetSpeciesAdj]§! scientific community, and their mythical existence still hotly debated to this day."
