 inf_usage_40003_desc_b:0 "\nEarly on, the Network devoted its resources overwhelmingly to research and technological innovation, seeing scientific progress as the most reliable method of survival. In its early form, [inf_usage_40000_target_planet.GetName] was a throroughly interconnected grid with vast data processing capabilities."
 inf_usage_40003_desc_c:0 "\nAs it advanced, focus shifted towards civic development. The research infrastructure was cannibalised for material to construct truly vast regions of secular infrastructure, eventually even building them in the sky to save room. It surely would have evolved into a Machine Ecumenopolis, were it not for the first assault of their creators, which devastated the city structures, blasting their floating islands from the heavens, and leaving the Synthetic civilisation severely incapacitated."
 inf_usage_40003_desc_d:0 "\nThe small band of survivng drones spent decades rebuilding from the ashes, now with an entirely new objective - aggressive survival. Aware that their progenitors would return one day to finish the job, they once again reformed the planet. The result was a formidable military stronghold, with a powerful shipyard ready to produce a grand fleet, quickly and inexpensively. It was mere weeks too late, as the second assault came as the shipyard's first wave of defense craft was under construction, and the Machine empire was wiped from existence and lost to the ages."
