 apsr.5011.desc:0  "While performing surveyance of the system, our expedition team from ship §H[Root.GetName]§! found something interesting. A single city covers the entire surface of the planet, lakes and oceans included. Strangely, it seems very well preserved, not affected by the passage of time. The previous inhabitants seem to have reached the Early Space Age, but some of their technology seems to be better developed than our own. This new insight will greatly help our understanding of engineering."
